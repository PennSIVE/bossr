\title{Threshold a 4D image}
\usage{
threshold.4d(img, thr, n.cores = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{4D array of image}

\item{thr}{matrix of threshold values (one for each slice and time point of the image)}

\item{n.cores}{number of cores to use for parallel processing}
}
\value{
4D binary mask
}
\description{
The function applies a threshold to each slice and time point of the 4D image using threshold.2d function,
creating a 4D binary mask where all the pixels with values greater than the threshold in each slice and time point are set to 1 and the rest are set to 0.
}
\examples{
threshold.4d(img, matrix(c(120, 130, 140, 130, 140, 150), ncol = 2), 2)
}
